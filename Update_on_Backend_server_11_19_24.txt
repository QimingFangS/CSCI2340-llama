Note: I added the flask API this morning, and it works okay. I am running it on my local GitHub repo right now, when deploying 
on Azure VM, it runs so slow even I changed to high-performance env. Please be aware that although it is almost fully functional,
there exist some potential bugs/issues as it is still under fully testing.
